### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer at Novacare making websites for our clients. On the side I'm running hvemder.no, a service to help consumers protect themselves against telemarketers.

I'm mostly working on web development in the Microsoft corner of the tech realm. I'm a backender working close to the frontend. The repositories here are mostly me trying out new technologies.
